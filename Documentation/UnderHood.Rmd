# Introduction

The Reproducible Reporting pipeline promoted by AuthorCarpentry relies on a stack of technologies that work together to make plain text authoring simple, reliable, enjoyable, and powerful. This conceptual stack is represented below.(Figure copied from RStudio, "How It Works", https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html)

# Workflow Components

## RMarkdown

Markdown is a set of simple markup annotations for plain text files. R Markdown files (`.Rmd`) rely on a variant of Markdown known as [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). 


According to RStudio's [Markdown Basics](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html) tutorial, you can use Pandoc's Markdown to create the following elements in an RMarkdown file:

* Headers
* Lists
* Links
* Images
* Block quotes
* Latex equations
* Horizontal rules
* Pipe tables
* Footnotes
* Bibliographies and Citations
* Slide breaks
* Italicized text
* Bold text
* Superscripts
* Subscripts
* Strikethrough text

To create and save generic markdown files (`.md`) for use in markdown-native platforms, e.g., GitHub, you will need to configure your YAML

## Knitr

Knitr is an R package that executes all of the code chunks and inline code in an Rmarkdown document. It then creates a new markdown (`.md`) document which includes the code and its output.

## Pandoc

Pandoc is considered the swiss army knife of document converters because it can transform a number of different markup formats such as .md or .html to many other formats, such as .doc, .pdf, html_slides, etc. Pandoc is also able to render rferences in a document to properly-formatted citations that follow a particular citation style.

Pandoc is a command line tool that is independent from R. However, it comes bundled with R Studio because Rmarkdown relies on it for document conversion.
