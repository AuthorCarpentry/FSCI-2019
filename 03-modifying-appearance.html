<h2>Document Sections</h2>

<p>We have lots of sections in our document; it would be nice if these were
listed in a table of contents and numbered so we could easily refer to a
specific section.  We don&rsquo;t want to have to manually update the table of
contents or renumber everything when we move sections around; we want <code>knitr</code> to do as much as possible automagically.</p>

<p>In order to customize the appearance of our document, we need to pass
information to <code>knitr</code> about what we want.  We use the YAML header, where we
customized the title and author, in order to set specific options.</p>

<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

<p>In the YAML we have a number of output formats.  You&rsquo;ll notice when you change
the <code>knitr</code> output format that the format you&rsquo;re interested in moves to the top
of the list.  We can make customizations to the format by removing the word
<code>default</code> after the format and including an indented list of options.  If we
want to include a table of contents, we add the option <code>toc: yes</code> to both the
<code>word_document</code> and <code>html_document</code> formats.  Then use the knit button to see
the results.</p>

<p>There are options that impact the appearance of the TOC.  For example, you can
remove a layer of TOC dub-sections (like &lsquo;Metadata&rsquo; under Data being collected) by using the
option <code>toc_depth: 2</code></p>

<h3>Section Numbers and Formatting</h3>

<p>Section numbering is where the behavior of different formats starts to diverge.
To add section numbers to our HTML document we just need to add the option
<code>number_sections: yes</code>.  We can also have the TOC appear as a document sidebar
by adding <code>toc_float: yes</code> to our options.</p>

<p>For the Word document, section numbering is controlled by the document theme
(below).</p>

<h2>Document Themes and Custom Formatting</h2>

<h3>HTML</h3>

<p>The <code>knitr</code> package supports built-in themes that format the overall document. <a href="https://bootswatch.com/3/">Click
here to view available themes</a>.  You can control
which theme is used for the document by adding <code>theme: readable</code>.  Try
switching our a different theme and see what happens!</p>

<p>These themes are built using standard web Cscading Style Sheets (CSS).  If we don&rsquo;t like how any of the built in themes look, we can add a CSS style sheet to make specific changes.  In our exercise file document, the quoted text looks too big; the font is larger than the surrounding text!  We&rsquo;ll control this oddity with a style sheet. To do so, make a
text file by going to <code>File/New File/Text File</code> in RStudio.  This will open up
an editor window where you can paste the following CSS code chunk:</p>

<pre><code>blockquote {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    margin: 0 0 20px;
    font-size: 14px;
    border-left: 5px solid #eee;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will edit the spacing and font size of all the quotes in the document. You
can use similar standard CSS to modify the appearance of all other elements in
your document. Remember markdown is really just an easy way of indicating HTML
tags, and CSS lets you modify those tags.</p>

<p>When you have a completed css file, click the save icon and save the file
as <code>custom.css</code>.  Note that you can call the file anything you want, but it&rsquo;s
good to include the css extension.  You can then load this file in your
document by adding the option <code>css: custom.css</code> to your YAML header.</p>

<h3>Word</h3>

<p>You can customize Word document styling, such as fonts, sizing, and section
numbering, within the  Word program.  You can then provide <code>knitr</code> with the stylized Word document to use as a style sheet of sorts .  Because editing word document styling
is a pain, we&rsquo;ve created a Word document with section numbering that you can use.
You just need to add <code>reference_docx: &quot;Base_2013_day3_style.docx&quot;</code> to the YAML
header for the <code>word_document</code> type and knit to see the result.</p>

<h2>Integrated Code</h2>

<p>The benefit of using Rstudio to author reports is that you have the
ability to perform computation, live within the document.  First, let&rsquo;s load some
data into our exercise file.  Look at the top of the file where the DOAJ data is
imported in a code chunk.  Code chunks are demarcated by three tics ```.  The first group
of tics is followed by a label that indicates the type of code and a
description.  So, the label in this example is <code>{r add_dataset}</code>.  You&rsquo;ll see
RStudio makes pretty formatting around the code chunk.  There are options for
each chunk, and you can run the code by clicking the green arrow.  Then you
press the arrow, you&rsquo;ll notice an output message and a change in the right
&lsquo;Environment&rsquo; section of RStudio.  The message is the output from the
operation, and the right panel shows that the data file has been loaded.  You
can hide the output message by clicking on the up arrow or modifying the options
so that <code>message=FALSE</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s add a new code chunk that will do something fun! At the bottom of the
&lsquo;Project Description&rsquo; add a new code chunk with the label <code>{r plot_country,echo= FALSE,fig.width=10,fig.height=11}</code></p>

<p>Open <code>insert_day3a.txt</code> and copy the code to the body of the code chunk.</p>

<p>Hit the green button and you&rsquo;ll see a plot appear, generated by the <code>ggplot2</code> package.  When you knit the document,
this code will also execute and place a plot in the document.</p>

<p>We can do the same thing to generate additional plots.  Add the code from
`insert_day3b.txt with the
label &lsquo;plot_license&rsquo; before the section on Metadata.</p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p>References are another area of document preparation where automation is really
helpful.  References in <code>knitr</code> are handled with BibtTx files (.bib). BibTex is a
reasonably standard format that can be produced by most reference managers and
online services.  We&rsquo;ve provided the bibliography <code>oajournals.bib</code> file for you to work with
during this course.  There is an entire section of the YAML header called <code>bibliography</code> that handles
references . You then provide<code>knitr</code> with the name of the
BibTex file, for example:</p>

<pre><code>bibliography:
- oajournals.bib
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s open our <code>oajournals.bib</code> file and see what it looks like.  You&rsquo;ll see
citation information about each article in groups indicated by a document type tag, e.g.,  <code>@article</code>, followed by a unique citation key (typically the last name of an author and the year of publication e.g. Yound_2015), followed by citation information.  If you look at the exercise document, you&rsquo;ll note that all of the citations have thus far been written manually (e.g., Castro et al
(2017)).  We&rsquo;ll want to replace them by machine readable tags that <code>knitr</code> will
be able to combine into a Reference List at the end of the report.  We use the @ symbol to indicate a
reference, so replace each reference with the appropriate tag, for example
<code>@Castro_2017</code>.</p>

<p>The reference list is automatically added to the end of the document, so we can
delete the dummy references that were there.  You&rsquo;ll notice that
<code>Vasilevsky_2017</code> showed up in the text as <code>n.d.</code>, even though it&rsquo;s in the
reference list.  If we look in the BibTex file, we see that no authors and date
are defined for this reference.  <code>Knitr</code> tries its best, but won&rsquo;t correct or complete referendes if the proper data is not available in the <code>.bib</code> file.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s fix the problem by grabbing a correct .bib file.  One great source is the
DOI registration agencies.  Put the DOI for <code>Vasilevsky_2017</code>,
<code>10.7717/peerj.3208</code> into the <a href="https://citation.crosscite.org/">cross cite
service</a> and select bibtex as the citation
style.  Copy the bibtex into oajournals.bib, change the long default citation
key to <code>Vasilevsky_2017</code>, and see how the citation is now correct.</p>

<h2>Embedded Sub-Documents and Math</h2>

<p>To date we&rsquo;ve been writing everything in one Rmarkdown document.  We can
actually build our document from sub-documents that <code>knitr</code> will integrate into
the output.  The sub-documents (aka child documents) do not have to contain a complete YAML header because they are designed to be intergrated into the &lsquo;main document&rsquo; or &lsquo;parent&rsquo; at knit time.</p>

<p>To see how this works, find a document in your folder called <code>equations-child.Rmd</code>.  You
can see that this file has a minimal header followed by some
Rmarkdown text.  You&rsquo;ll also see some equations written in LateX.  That&rsquo;s
right; you can write LateX within an RMarkdown document and it will get correctly formatted at knit time.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s add the child document at the end of the &lsquo;Project Description&rsquo;.  You
add child documents with a code chunk, and include the document location in the
label, for example: <code>{r equations, child = &quot;equations-child.Rmd&quot;}</code>.</p>

<p>When you knit you get nicely formatted equation in both Html and Word.</p>

<p>Using multiple child-documents is a convenient and tidy way to manage multiple sections in a single long report. Each section can be authored and tested seperately without bogging <code>knitr</code> down with one long scrolling document. Additionally, if just one section needs to be changed or updated over time, the parent-child authoring approach isolates the change to the necessary file without opening (and possibly introducing errors inadvertenly) to the longer parent.</p>
